# Multi-Agent Travel Planner System

**Assignment:** Build a Multi-Agent System using LangChain + LangGraph

## 📋 Overview

This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent AI system that creates comprehensive travel plans through the collaboration of 4 specialized agents. The system uses LangGraph for workflow orchestration and LangChain for LLM integration.

## 🤖 Agent Architecture

### Agent 1: Planner Agent
- **Role:** Extracts structured information from natural language travel requests
- **Input:** Raw user input (free text)
- **Output:** Destination, travel dates, budget, preferences
- **Technology:** JSON parsing with error handling

### Agent 2: Research Agent
- **Role:** Gathers destination information and travel insights
- **Input:** Destination and user preferences
- **Output:** Top attractions, highlights, practical travel tips
- **Technology:** Context-aware LLM prompting

### Agent 3: Itinerary Builder Agent
- **Role:** Creates detailed day-by-day travel itineraries
- **Input:** Destination, dates, preferences, research notes
- **Output:** Structured daily itinerary with activities
- **Technology:** Multi-context synthesis

### Agent 4: Budget Estimator Agent
- **Role:** Provides cost analysis and budget breakdown
- **Input:** Destination, dates, budget, itinerary
- **Output:** Cost breakdown (accommodation, transport, food, activities)
- **Technology:** Budget feasibility analysis

## 🔄 LangGraph Workflow

```
START → Planner Agent → Research Agent → Itinerary Builder → Budget Estimator → END
```

**Workflow Features:**
- Sequential agent execution with shared state
- Each agent updates specific fields in `TravelState`
- Directed edges ensure proper information flow
- Error handling at each node

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **LangGraph:** Workflow orchestration and state management
- **LangChain:** LLM integration and prompt templates
- **Groq API:** Free-tier LLM (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
- **Streamlit:** Web-based user interface
- **Python 3.14:** Core implementation language
